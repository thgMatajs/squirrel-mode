# 6. Importance orders two otherwise identical memories.
#
#    THE IDS ARE CHOSEN SO THE TIEBREAK OPPOSES THE ANSWER. Ordering is
#    score desc, then id ASC, so a reader with no working score at all
#    falls back to id order - and if the important memory's id happened
#    to sort first, this scenario would pass against a reader that scores
#    nothing. `a-unimportant` sorts before `z-important`, so id order
#    puts the WRONG answer first and only a real score can pass. This is
#    also what makes scenario 8b's mutation proof meaningful rather than
#    accidentally satisfied.
#
#    last_used is deliberately far-future (20991231), the same clamp
